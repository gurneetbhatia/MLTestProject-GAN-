K. and H. assure the public\nTheir production will be second to none\nAnd of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!\n\nThe band begins at ten to six\nWhen Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound\nAnd Mr. H. will demonstrate\nTen somersets he'll undertake on solid ground\nHaving been some days in preparation\nA splendid time is guaranteed for all\nAnd tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0e36e5abf5d93b95a6d8c30652b66e15.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Beatles"}
